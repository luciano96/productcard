### What I learned

With this challenge I discovered a google extension called "ResponsiveViewer" that allowed me to view simultaneously both breakpoints that I had to consider.
I have also learned about the `<picture>` tag that allows me to source different sized images to a `<img>` tag based on breakpoint.
